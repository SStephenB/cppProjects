/* Code submitted as assignment for SYDE 121 (Digital Computation C++) course. 
Objective: User inputs the weight of an objects (e.g. 100 lbs) and the program automatically calculates how many weights of different values are needed to reach that weight.
(e.g. 100 lbs can be divided into one 75 lb weight, one 15 lb weight, and ten 1 lb weights).

Step 1) Before the program was modified to enable the user to input the initial weight, the program was tested with the initial weight being 2048 lb.
		When computing the results on paper, I got:
			- 2048 / 125 = 16 R 48
			- 48 / 75 = no solution
			- 48 / 42 = 1 R 6
			- 6 / 15 = no solution
			- 6 / 6 = 6 R 0
		When I ran the program at first, I was not getting these values, and instead, the remainder was 0 after the first calculation that the program made.
		After investigating this issue, I discovered that I accidently set the object weight to get the remainder of the quotient from the first calculation, thus making all the values 0.
		After this issue was fixed, the program was outputting the correct numbers!

Step 2) In this step, the program was modified to enable the user to input the initial weight, and the program was tested with two other values for the initial weight.
		Value 1: 4061
		When computing the results on  paper, I got:
			 - 4061 / 125 = 32 R 61
			 - 61 / 75 = no solution
			 - 61 / 42 = 1 R 19
			 - 19 / 15 = 1 R 4
			 - 4 / 1 = 4 R 0
		When setting 4061 as the initial weight, the program outputted the correct numbers.

		Value 2: 1779
		When computing the results on paper, I go:
			- 1779 / 125 = 14 R 29
			- 29 / 75 = no solution
			- 29 / 42 = no solution
			- 29 / 15 = 1 R 14
			- 14 / 1 = 14 R 0
